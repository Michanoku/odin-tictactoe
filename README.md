## Thoughts on the Project

Trying to build this without the use of lots of global code was a challenge.
During practice, I barely had a grip on factories and IIFE's. 
I will probably still need some more time to have a more thorough understanding,
but this project helped a lot in making me more comfortable with it.
I made many considerations to structure the script.js like I did, but I'm pretty sure
there may still be best practices I'm unaware of. However, I am glad it worked
out without as many issues as I thought, even though this took me some time to build.

I really enjoy working with grid, even though sometimes I still get unexpected results.

Doing more granular commits has been working on and off. I still keep forgetting sometimes and then write 
80 lines of code that are then hard to fit in a commit message. Well, the ongoing point to improve.
